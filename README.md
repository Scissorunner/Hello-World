# Hello-World
Need to start somewhere
Retired, started with Arduino and analog circuits in Oct 2019. Currently have successfully copied several ESP8266 / ESP32 projects... Weather Station with Squix / Thingpulse code.
Next step is to learn MicroPython well enough to build my own code or very least understand others code to use as building blocks.
